# AntsSimulation

### Project description
Project for "System Modelling and Simulation" ("Modelowanie i Symulacja System√≥w") course of Computer Science Master's major in AGH Academy of Science and Technology.

### Main world concepts:
 - The world is rectangular.
 - Each ant thinks for itself and acts on it's own depending on: the random factor, the strength and type of pheromones in it's viscinity in front of them.
 - The ants target is to find food and get it back to their nest.
 - The ants leave traces of pheromones wherever they go ("return to base" pheromone).
 - When an ant finds food source, it leaves traces of a different pheromone ("food source" pheromone).

### Possible world concepts:
 - The world is 3D. It has depth and depending on this depth the ants go slower/faster.
 - The world has obstacles that ants can't get through.
 - The pheromones change their position based on the wind.
 - The pheromones diffuse faster or slower depending on the temperature.
 - There are multiple nests (factions) of ants that don't cooperate with each other and prefer to stay separate.
 - Ants die when they're not in their nest for too long. They also change their choices depending on their own health.

### Environment
 - Language: ![Python](https://www.python.org/) `3.10.3`
 - Game engine: ![Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/about)
